Operators are used to perform and operation and between operands.
E.g.: a + b is an addition operation with + as an operator and a, b as operands.

There are several operators sush as:
    i. Arithmetic Operators
        Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations.
        '+' -- used for addtition
        '-' -- used for subraction
        '*' -- used for multiplication
        '/' -- used for division -- It will give exact value unlike other programming language. 10/2 = 5 in js, and 10/2 = 0 in python, java.
        '%' -- used for modulus -- 7/2 = 3.5 ,, 7%2 = 1.
        '**' -- used for power, eg 2**3 = 2*2*2 = 8. or [math.pow().]
    
    2. Relational Operators:
        Relational operators are used to perform comparisons and returns boolean values. 
        E.g.
        > -- greater than
        < -- less than
        >= -- greater than or equals to
        <= -- less than or equals to
        == -- double equals is used to compare two values.
        === -- triple equals is used to compare two values and datatypes.
        != -- will be true when both values are not equals to each other
        !== -- will be true when both values are not equals to each other or datatypes.
        e.g. '5' == 5 --> True, '5' === 5 --> False
        0 == false --> true, 0 === false --> F
        '1' == true -- T, '1' === --> F.

    3. Logical Operators:
        Logical operators are used to perform logical conditions, such as:
            
            AND -- && -- Both values are true. Used to check multiple conditions based on AND.
            E.g.: (5>2) && (5>4) -- True

            OR -- || -- True when any of the condition is True. Used to check multiple conditions based on OR.
            e.g.: (5>2) || (5>6) -- True
            
            NOT --! - Used to check whether condition is false or not.
            e.g.: !(10>5) --!(true) --> False.
