Git commands to update repository on GitHub after editing locally:
=================================================================

git status  --> this will show the modified files.
git add .  --> this will stage the changes.
git commit -m "updated tables in html"  --> provide meaningful message describing what you changed.
git push / git push origin main - send the updates to the remote repository by pushing the changes to GitHub.




Git Push differences:
====================
git push -u origin main  --> recommende for first time
git push --> for subsequent pushes after tracking branch is already set up.
git push origin <branch(i.e. main)> --> push explicitely without setting up tracking. 


Git Pull:
========
It is to keep local branch up-to-date with remote repository.
Fetch remote changes: download updates from remote branch and merge into local branch.
git pull --> download and merge updates only when local branch is already tracking a remote branch.
git pull origin main --> same as git pull but uses explicite branch name to merge.
